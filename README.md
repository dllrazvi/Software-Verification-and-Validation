# Software System Verification and Validation (SSVV)

## Course Overview

This course focuses on **formal methods and systematic techniques** for verifying and validating software systems. Students work both individually and in teams to inspect documentation, evaluate code quality, and analyze tools for testing and review. The approach balances theory with practical assignments including inspection techniques, tool-based reviews, and test case design.

---

## Lab 1 – Document and Code Inspection, Feature Tour Testing

### Objectives:
- Practice **manual inspection** of requirements, design, and source code using structured checklists.
- Conduct **feature tour testing** by exploring a working application and identifying key features.
- Use a **code review tool** (such as Gerrit, CodePanorama, RefDistiller) to highlight and record defects.

### Deliverables:
- Requirement and Design Review Forms (min. 5 documented defects)
- Feature Tour list (min. 5 discovered features)
- Short video (3–5 min) with commentary showing the chosen tool in action
- Java Maven project demonstrating functionality (e.g., add student, add lab, assign grades)

---

## Lab 2–3 – Code Review and Integration

- Extend the Maven project with integration of the review results
- Refactor code based on findings from review tools
- Add minimum three core functionalities and ensure basic interactions are wired up

---

## Test Case Design Portfolio (Seminar Assignment)

### Objectives:
- Evaluate tools for **automatic test case generation**
- Analyze and apply academic solutions to real codebases
- Create both **written summaries** and **video walkthroughs** of testing tools

### Deliverables:
1. **Summary Document** (max 1 page):
   - Overview of a selected academic paper
   - Tool motivation, novelty, and validation method
   - Includes title, DOI, and team info

2. **Tool Analysis Document** (max 1 page):
   - How the testing tool was installed and used
   - Practical findings and 3–5 screenshots from testing session

3. **Video Presentation**:
   - 3–5 min narrated video showing the tool in a live scenario
   - Explanation of findings and benefits of the tool

---

## Tools & Concepts Explored

- Maven Project Management
- Java Code Review Tools: Gerrit, CodePanorama, RefDistiller
- Manual Defect Checklists for Requirements, Design, and Code
- Feature Tour Testing as exploratory strategy
- Academic tools for automatic test case generation

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students are expected to:
- Understand formal inspection methods and their role in quality assurance
- Use code review platforms in real-world team scenarios
- Analyze academic tools for automated testing and apply them to live codebases
- Communicate technical findings via documentation and screencasts
